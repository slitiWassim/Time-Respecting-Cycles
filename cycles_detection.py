# ---- Main function ----
def time_respecting_cycles(

):
    """
    Enumerate **time-respecting cycles** in a Raphtory temporal directed graph.

    This algorithm identifies all elementary cycles where the sequence of edge timestamps
    is **strictly increasing** â€” ensuring that the traversal follows the arrow of time.
    It combines a structural depth-first cycle search (based on Johnson's algorithm [1]_)
    with efficient temporal validation using stored edge timestamp histories.

    The procedure builds preliminary (min, max) timestamp intervals for each edge to quickly
    prune impossible transitions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rolling_g : Raphtory Graph
        A Raphtory temporal knowledge graph. 

    max_length : int, optional
        Maximum number of distinct nodes allowed in a cycle.
        Limits cycle depth to control computational growth.
        Default is ``None`` (no structural limit).

    max_cycles : int, optional
        Stop after this many **valid** cycles have been found.
        Prevents memory overload in dense graphs. Default is ``None``.

    max_duration : int, optional
        Maximum duration (in milliseconds) between the earliest and latest
        timestamps within a cycle. Cycles exceeding this temporal span are skipped.
        Default is ``None`` (no duration filter).

    visited_memo : bool, optional, default=True
        Enables memoization of previously visited node-interval states during
        backtracking. This dramatically reduces redundant recursion and speeds
        up traversal on large graphs.

    Yields
    ------
    (cycle_nodes, cycle_timestamps) : 
        - **cycle_nodes** : list of node names forming a cycle (start node repeated at end).
        - **cycle_timestamps** : list of timestamps (strictly increasing) associated with the edges.

        Each yielded pair corresponds to a time-respecting cycle

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm proceeds in several conceptual stages:


    1. **Interval-based temporal adjacency (min, max) construction:**  
       For every edge, build `(t_min, t_max)` intervals 

    2. **SCC decomposition:**  
       Identify strongly connected components (SCCs) using Raphtory's built-in method.
       Following the implementation of NetworkX for detecting cycles in directed graphs,
       Johnson's algorithm is enhanced with well-known preprocessing techniques by restricting
       the search to strongly connected components. https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/networkx/algorithms/cycles.py

    3. **Johnson-style search:**  
       Perform a modified Johnson's backtracking algorithm within each SCC to
       enumerate structural cycles, pruned by temporal interval compatibility.
      
    4. **Cycle validation:**  
       Each structural cycle is checked via ``validate_cycle()`` to ensure that
       an increasing sequence of timestamps exists along the edges.

    5. **Yielding results:**  
       Only temporally valid cycles are yielded. Duration, length, and count
       constraints are enforced throughout.
